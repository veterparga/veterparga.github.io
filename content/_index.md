          Welcome to my humble website. I'm always happy to connect and would love to hear from you - please don't hesitate to reach out to me on my socials!

          As a versatile data professional, I find delight in building impactful and efficient tech solutions for all things analytics. I've been working in mostly in the gaming industry with data engineering as a core responsibility, setting up data stacks from scratch, transforming BI operations, and enabling large-scale data science experimentation. You can read more about my experiences [here]({{< relref "/experience" >}}).

          Additionally, advancing humanityâ€™s collective knowledge is a lifelong pursuit for me. In my free time, I enjoy working on various research projects, whether as an author, editor, reviewer or consultant. If you're interested, you can check out some of my contributions to the science of gaming & esports [here]({{< relref "/research" >}}).

          Complexity science, interdisciplinarity, and the phenomena of digital worlds fascinate me. I often ponder how we can learn about brain circuits and computations through interacting with digital environments, as well as how complex simulations can reveal insights on the mechanics of large systems, whether it's about social behaviour or ecology. 

          As a qualified teacher and a certified strength & conditioning coach, I'm always keen to chat all things education and physical training, but also hit me up if you want to exchange tips on music production and composing!
