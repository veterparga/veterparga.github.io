          Welcome to my humble website. Feel free to browse around to learn more about my professional journey, or download my resume if you're looking for a quick summary. I'm always happy to connect and would love to hear from you - please don't hesitate to reach out to me on my socials!

          Through my career I found great delight in being curious, adaptive, and useful to my community. Iâ€™m fortunate that the companies Iâ€™ve worked at have nurtured these strengths â€” allowing me to explore new tools and technologies to build impactful solutions for a variety of teams. Itâ€™s been a rewarding cycle: solving real problems for people, making a difference in the company, and growing into roles with greater ownership. You can read more about my experiences [here]({{< relref "/experience" >}}).

          As a kid, I dreamed of becoming a Nobel Prize-winning scientist. While I canâ€™t say how close (or far) I am to that, one thing is certain â€” my passion for research didnâ€™t fade when I left academia. Contributing to humanityâ€™s collective knowledge feels like a lifelong pursuit for me, driven not by prizes now, but by an innate curiosity and passion. If you're interested, you can check out some of my contributions to the science of gaming & esports [here]({{< relref "/research" >}}).

          I feel incredibly lucky that science is one of my main hobbies. Iâ€™m constantly pondering and reading about the discoverable mechanisms that operate in the world around us. Thatâ€™s the great thing about curiosity - itâ€™s like a mental itch we can scratch, and scratching can be super satisfying. Since high school and my time at UCL, I've been fascinated by how brain structures, circuits, and computations shape us as individuals and as a collective. With my industry experience, I also follow the latest in gamification, digital play, educational technology, and decentralized science.
