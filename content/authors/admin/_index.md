      Earned a First Class for my Master's Thesis in Neurodevelopmental Imaging, researching X-chromosome linked neural tract morphology differences in young adults with autism using diffusion-weighted MRI. I believe having the opportunity to be exposed to cutting-edge neuroimaging research planted a seed of curiosity in me to really understand how the brain develops, functions, and how it is reflected in our individual & collective behaviour.
