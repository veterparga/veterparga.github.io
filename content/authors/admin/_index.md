      Earned a First Class for my Master's Thesis in Neurodevelopmental Imaging, researching X-chromosome linked neural tract morphology differences in young adults with autism using diffusion-weighted MRI. I believe having the opportunity to be exposed to cutting-edge neuroimaging research planted a seed of curiosity in me to really understand how the brain develops, functions, and how it is reflected in our individual & collective behaviour.

    summary: |
      SIDO is a small research & consultancy firm working on innovative projects in gaming - understanding how people learn & play games, and sharing knowledge through analytics products and consulting projects. As an R&D Lead, I was the manager and bridging point between these two units - research and product - while being the main point-of-contact for both academic and strategic partnerships.

      With my previous success levelling up data operations, I implemented a performant data backend to enable efficient data science experimentation with TBs of in-game data. With compute-heavy workflows running quicker, we could optimize operations to serve both the product internally, and the statistics & gaming academic community as an active contributor.

      Our product was used by the best Western League of Legends teams - based on World Championship placements. Understanding the high-pressure competitive environments these teams operate in, I knew we needed a close relationship with our users, and work with engineering to place a strong emphasis on customer-requested features while maintaining maximal uptime and reliability. 

      One of my favourite features of innovation was implementing voice-communication analytics into our product. Having worked in esports for a number of years at this point, I noticed how paramount team dynamics & strategic collaboration is in competitive gaming, and because noone has ever analyzed it neither quantitatively or qualitatively, I wanted to build evidence. First in the industry, our product had signal analytics displayed together with in-game data, showing customers patterns between in-game events and communication, and anecdotally, assisting with information exchange & decision making during games. After sharing these experiences with some fellow academics, I was connected with Routledge to propose a book on Voice Communication Analytics in Esports & Competitive Gaming.
  - position: Senior Engineer (Research & Analytics) 
    company_name: Fnatic
    date_start: 2022-06-01
    date_end: 2023-09-01
    summary: |
      With strong data operations in place across the business, I was able to take on greater ownership of both analytics and research initiatives. One of my key projects was a six-month collaboration with our League of Legends academy team, where I partnered with Spectre Biotech to integrate portable, wireless, dry-electrode EEG devices for brain activity monitoring. The pilot study focused on weekly biomarker assessments to track player well-being, with intervention and neurofeedback training protocols triggered by deviations from baseline. We expanded the study using smartwatches to cross-check sleep biomarkers. That season, the team went on to win the Superliga trophy with a record-breaking score.

      At the same time, our main League of Legends team needed more advanced analytics software, which I managed alongside a front-end designer. We prioritized scouting capabilities and a self-serve analytics model that had already proven highly effective in the business. Notably, as we rolled out the tool and trained users, the team rebounded from two consecutive last-place finishes to securing silver in the summer split, qualifying for the World Championship, with our newest scout setting a new KDA record in the league.

    date_start: 2021-06-01
    date_end: 2022-06-01
    summary: |
      Fnatic is a leading global esports brand, renowned for its championship-winning teams, developing gaming peripherals & apparel business, and partnering with industry-leading brands.

      As an esports fan, joining the tech team was incredibly exciting - I had the chance to directly impact a competitive team’s success with my software! Alongside the Data Lead, I implemented a high-performance modern data stack, breaking down data silos and unlocking deeper, more accurate business intelligence. This included self-serve BI, a machine learning-powered forecasting and inventory management tool, and second-by-second in-game analytics for our League of Legends team.

      Beyond my core role, I managed our first College Partnership program, collaborating with three leading UK colleges to provide lectures, networking events, industry experience, and tournaments for the next generation of esports and gaming students.
  - position: Junior Data Scientist
    company_name: Mews
    date_start: 2020-06-01
    date_end: 2021-06-01
    summary: |
      As the pandemic struck and travel restrictions took effect, revenue from guest transactions dropped sharply. To enhance customer care and uncover upselling opportunities, I built data pipelines to analyze user interactions across our app and integrated systems. This provided a comprehensive view of feature usage, pain points, and learning management system engagement, while also improving dashboards and refining churn prediction models.

      I also actively participated in our Salesforce PoC and, during implementation, developed automations to integrate market data, user metrics, and model outputs into the Salesforce ecosystem, enhancing efficiency for sales and account management teams.

      Experiencing the impact of both data engineering and frontline analytics made me realize that while data science and experimentation are exciting, I’m more excited about building end-to-end solutions that solve immediate problems.
  - position: Research Analyst
    company_name: Mews
    date_start: 2019-09-01
    date_end: 2020-06-01
    summary: |
      Mews is a cloud-based hospitality management platform designed to streamline hotel operations and enhance guest experiences. 

      When I joined, the company was scaling up to around 100 employees and still defining its place in the market. To support KPI development and GTM strategy, I built scrapers and API integrations with major hospitality platforms, creating a comprehensive, unified database of hotels, hostels, and apartments worldwide. This dataset became a key resource for discussions on market segmentation, lead generation, and long-term growth projections.

      As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, I automated global news collection and focused on churn analytics, developing a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving due to travel restrictions.

      Wild.AI is a platform designed to empower women by providing personalized health and fitness insights tailored to their unique physiological stages.

      Joining Wild.AI in its early stages meant diving straight into the deep end of tech product development. I was responsible for integrating existing scientific research - through literature reviews and expert interviews - into both our branding and representation. Additionally, I worked with our engineers on shaping our machine learning models & front-end to help female athletes better understand their bodies throughout the menstrual cycle.
